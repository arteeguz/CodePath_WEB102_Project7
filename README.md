# Web Development Project 7 - *Crewmates*

Submitted by: **Artem Guz**

This web app: **This web application allows users to manage "crewmates," where they can add, view, edit, and delete entries. Each crewmate has attributes like name, speed, and color, and users can interact with these entries through a straightforward interface.**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **A create form allows users to add new cremates**
- [x] **Users can name the crewmate and set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values**
- [x] **The site displays a summary page of all the user's added crewmates**
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the crewmate list**
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**
- [x] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique link to an info page about them**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attributes
- [x] The site displays summary statistics about a user's crew on their crew page 
- [ ] The site displays a custom "success" metric about a user's crew which changes the look of the crewmate list

## Notes

Keeping the application state consistent across CRUD operations was challenging.
